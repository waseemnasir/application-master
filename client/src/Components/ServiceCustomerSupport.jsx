                    To simplify the procedure of paying out for your car, we
                    have recently introduced our Loan Payment Program. It allows
                    our customers to schedule their monthly loan payments to be
                    automatically withdrawn each month from their AutoTraider
                    account. Taking part in such a program also has a range of
                    benefits including discounts on technical inspection.
